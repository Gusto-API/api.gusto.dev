        In order to reduce the number of time off requests returned in a single response, or to retrieve time off requests from a time period of interest, you may use the `start_date` and `end_date` parameters.

        You may provide both or either parameters to scope the returned data. For example:

        `?start_date='2019-01-01'`

        Returns all time off requests where the request start date is equal to or after January 1, 2019.

        `?end_date='2019-01-01'`

        Returns all time off requests where the request end date is equal to or before January 1, 2019.
         
        `?start_date='2019-05-01'&end_date='2019-08-31'`

        Returns all time off requests where the request start date is equal to or after May 1, 2019 and the request end date is equal to or before August 31, 2019.
