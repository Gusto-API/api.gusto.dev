# DEPRECATED

As part of our migration to Readme, we will be moving to a new repo hosted within the internal Gusto organization. Please clone this new repository and make future documentation changes here: https://github.com/Gusto/Gusto-Partner-API. Note that all changes in this new repository will be pushed to Readme instead of Stoplight.

If you need documentation changes to reflect immediately on Stoplight, you can update this repository, but please note that we plan to deprecate our account with Stoplight in early March 2022. All documentation changes made in this repo (tied to Stoplight) should also be made in our new repo (tied to Readme).
