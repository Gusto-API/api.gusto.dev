  summary: Get time off requests for a company
  description: >-
    Returns an array of all time off requests, current and past, for a company.

    #### Optional Parameters

    In order to reduce the number of time off requests returned in a single response, or to retrieve time off requests from a time period of interest, you may use the `start_date` and `end_date` parameters.


    You may provide both or either parameters to scope the returned data. For example:


    Return all time off requests where the request start date is equal to or after May 1, 2019 and the  request end date is equal to or before August 31, 2019:


    `/v1/companies/:company_id/time_off_requests/start_date='2019-05-01'&end_date='2019-08-31'`


    Return all time off requests where the request start date is equal to or after January 1, 2019:


    `/v1/companies/:company_id/time_off_requests/start_date='2019-01-01'`


    Return all time off requests where the request end date is equal to or before January 1, 2019:


    `/v1/companies/:company_id/time_off_requests/end_date='2019-01-01'`
