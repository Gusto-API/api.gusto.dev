  summary: Get a location by ID

    Locations represent addresses inside Gusto. Locations may belong to a number of objects, from employees and contractors to companies, and return their respective association’s id via an appropriately named attribute. For example, a company location will have a `company_id` property while an employee’s home addres will instead have an `employee_id`.
