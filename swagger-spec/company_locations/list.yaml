  summary: Get locations for a company
  description: >-
    Returns an array of all locations for the company.


    Company locations represent all addresses associated with a company. These can be filing addesses, mailing addresses, and/or work locations; one address may serve multiple, or all, purposes.


    Since all company locations are subsets of locations, retrieving or updating an individual record should be done via the locations endpoints.

  parameters:
    - in: path
      type: string
      required: true
      name: company_id
      description: 'The unique identifier of the company whose locations you wish to retrieve.'
